Instance of WebDriver:
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

Open the Chrome browser and navigate to url:
        driver.get("https://syntaxprojects.com/");

maximize the window
        driver.manage().window().maximize();

enter the full screen mode
        driver.manage().window().fullscreen();

get the title of the page that you are currently on
        driver.getTitle();
        String title = driver.getTitle();
When you want the screen to shut
        Thread.sleep(2000); - is to slow down the process
        driver.quit(); - closes all windows
        driver.close();  - closes only current window
-------------------------------------------------------
Navigational Commands:
       driver.get(url);
           1. It doesnt keep any history, you cant go back or forward
           2. Waits for the webpage to completely load before going to the next command

       driver.navigate().to(url);
            1. It keeps history and allows you to go back and forward
            2. Doesn't wait for the webpage to load before going to the next command
